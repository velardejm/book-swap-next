1. Refactor the swap request queries.  (Check if still valid)
    
    Current:
        For new swap request queries, only the ids are saved. 
        When the swap request details are fetched, queries for 
        getting book details and book owner details are run for each
        swap request.
    
    Required update:
        When saving the swap requests, the offerred and requested book titles
        along with the Requestor name (and email?) must be saved in the db.
        By this way, no extra queries will be required.

2. Implement swap logic below

    1. In swap request window hide previously offerred books.
    2. If the requester cancels the request, it will appear again
        in the books that could be offerred
    3. Requested books may be requested by others.
        Scenario: A user will receive a request from two other
                    users for the same book. When the user accepts
                    one of the received requests, one will cancel
                    automatically. The update will be done
                    on the respective pages of the 3 users involved

Swap Requet Window:
    -Hide oferred books that are status:offerred or pending
    -Keep status of requested books as available:

When a swap request is sent:
    -Update sent requests of requester
    -Update received requests of requestee

When a swap requests is accepted
    -Update book ownership

When a swap request is cancelled
    -Return status of offerred book to available


3. Implement Swap Notification Feature
