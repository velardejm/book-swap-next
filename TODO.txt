1. Refactor the swap request queries.
    
    Current:
        For new swap request queries, only the ids are saved. 
        When the swap request details are fetched, queries for 
        getting book details and book owner details are run for each
        swap request.
    
    Required update:
        When saving the swap requests, the offerred and requested book titles
        along with the Requestor name (and email?) must be saved in the db.
        By this way, no extra queries will be required.
